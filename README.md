Senior Comunication Interface Prototype (No architecture, just a proof of concept.)


I built this simple interface to help my father comunicate with his family.
He had a stroke that left him unable to talk and make basic movements. 
The interface consists of some buttons that when pressed emit sounds, words like yes, no, etc.. 
It´s in Portuguese. 

To run just open index.html in a browser.


Feel free to use, modify ❤
